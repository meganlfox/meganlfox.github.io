## About Our Studio

Glass Bottom Games makes absurdly cozy games about animals doing people things. You'll wander around on cool foggy nights, make friends with detective cats, and meet tiny birbs trying their best to skateboard.

<a href="https://twitter.com/glassbottommeg">Megan Fox</a> formed the studio <a href="https://glassbottomgames.com/press/index.php">in 2011, and has been running it ever since</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/madsenstudios">Nathan Madsen</a> has composed our music since the beginning.

Beyond that, we work with different folks for each project! So, check our press kit to see the core teams credits of <a href="https://glassbottomgames.com/press/sheet.php?p=skatebird">SkateBIRD</a>, <a href="https://glassbottomgames.com/press/sheet.php?p=spartan_fist">Spartan Fist</a>, <a href="https://glassbottomgames.com/press/sheet.php?p=hot_tin_roof">Hot Tin Roof</a>, and <a href="https://glassbottomgames.com/press/sheet.php?p=jones_on_fire">Jones On Fire</a>. That's also where to find media and stuff for each game!
