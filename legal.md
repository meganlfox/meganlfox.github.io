## Privacy Policy

We don't store your data, period.

We physically can’t.  We have nowhere to store it.  We don’t even have a database on our server that we could store it in.

We do use the Unity 3D game engine, and you can see their GDPR and privacy statements here: <a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/gdpr">https://unity3d.com/legal/gdpr</a>

## Video Monetization Policy

If you have a channel on YouTube, Twitch, or a similar video sharing site, Glass Bottom Games grants you permission to monetize your videos of our games through those sites. This includes Let’s Plays, reviews, guides, and other fun videos that contain footage from our games. To clarify, this covers SKATEBIRD®, Spartan Fist, Hot Tin Roof, Jones On Fire, and any future Glass Bottom Games games, unless otherwise specified.

You may not, however, sell the footage, license the footage to someone else, or sell/claim ownership of any part of the games themselves (including, but not limited to, art/music assets and code). If you want to do something like this, please contact us and we'll see what we can do.

Oh, and a link to the game’s website in your video's description/etc is always appreciated. Thanks!

(and this is not an original policy or anything, it's a very slightly modified version of <a href="https://mossmouth.tumblr.com/post/59786950104/mossmouth-video-monetization-policy">Mosssmouth's Video Monetization policy</a>)
