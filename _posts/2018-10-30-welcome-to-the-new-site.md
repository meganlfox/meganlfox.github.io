How cool is this? It's been ages since we had a proper studio site. Midway through Spartan Fist dev, our trusty old Wordpress site got taken down by spam attack, and we didn't have time to deal with it, so - poof, it died. We just redirected the studio URL to the Spartan Fist page, since hey, that was the focus anyways then.

But now we're back! Yay! Excuse the dust, I'll be poking stuff a bit now and then. Trying to make it a bit less sterile, a bit more cute, without breaking the readability and nice hard edges. Should be fun!
