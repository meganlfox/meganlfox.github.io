This is our new game! Yay! Drop in, and be a skateboarding bird. Grind on bendy straws, kickflip over staplers, and carve killer lines through cardboard and sticky tape parks. Skate an expansively tiny world with simple controls even a Hawk named Tony would dig. Skatebird can't fly, but on a board, they soar.

Please wishlist it on Steam, it really helps us out. Don't forget to watch the trailer, it's super cute.
